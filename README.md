# dblint

dblint examines a relational database and makes suggestions to improve
structure.

dblint's suggestions come from my experience as a relational database
user and DBA.

At the moment, more is unimplemented than implemented, but it is a
short example of the kinds of problems Prolog is good at solving. 

## Future

In the future, dblint will be relatively database agnostic. It will
group recommendations into various categories, including style,
normalization and type suggestions. It will also generate SQL to
perform the changes it recommends.
